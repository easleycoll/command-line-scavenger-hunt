# Command Line Interface Scavenger Hunt

## Task

Use the commands you learned today to search for images of baby animals. When you locate the images of baby animals, you will move them into a directory named `cubs-and-pups`.

## Instructions

1. Check your location and then change directory into the `command-line-scavenger-hunt` directory

2. View all the files in your current directory

3. Create a new folder called `​cubs-and-pups`​ in the current directory

4. Create another new folder called `hedgehogs`​ in the current directory

5. Move all the hedgehog photos into the directory called `hedgehogs`. If there is a baby hedgehog image, move it into the `cubs-and-pups` directory.

6. Change directory into the ​bears ​directory. View all the files in the current directory.

7. Change into the ​black-bears​ directory. View all the files in the current directory

8. Use the ​open​ command to open the image using its default application.

   > Note: If the open command does not work for you, try using the command ​start

9. Search through the images of black bears and grizzly bears. When you find an image containing bear
   cubs, move it into the `cubs-and-pups` directory in the `cli-scavenger-hunt` directory

10. Repeat these steps with each animal: bears, cougars, foxes, and hedgehogs. When you are finished, there should be ​four​ files in the cubs-and-pups directory.
